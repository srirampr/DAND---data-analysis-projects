## Introduction <br>
<br>
For this project, we will conduct our own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. 
At first we start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. 
Then predominantly using pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we are most interested in, 
and create a report sharing the answers. 
<br><br>
This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
