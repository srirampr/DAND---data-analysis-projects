# This case study is about exploring Weather Trends <br>
## Summary <br>
In this project, we will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.
<br> 
The following are the steps we will take to analyse the data:<br>
Extract the data from the database using SQL and export it to CSV. <br>
Using Google sheets we explore the data.<br>
We compare the current city’s temperatures with the global temperatures and also plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.<br>
Then, we make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
